This is a reasonable estimate based on the company's view of the market going forward. There is upside potential to this guidance if the momentum continues, but there is also downside potential if inflationary pressures impact the second half. The company is experiencing more uncertainty than usual, but they are being sensible in the way they set their guidance out.\n\nIn relation to the second quarter, the company has good visibility over growth, and they expect continued momentum coming through from Q1 into Q2. However, they have moved from having office occupancy of around 60% or 70% back down to 5% in China due to recent lockdowns. This will have an impact on the second quarter, but in the most of markets they remain confident and have good line of sight of growth.\n\nThe margin guidance is unchanged for the full year. The math on this is that the company has upgraded its net sales guidance by around 1%, which will drop through to the margin.
